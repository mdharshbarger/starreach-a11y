        <h2>Our Founder: RH Locke</h2>
        <p>StarReach Aerospace was born from a single question: <em>What if the final frontier wasn’t final at all?</em></p>
        <p>RH Locke didn’t come from legacy aerospace. He wasn’t backed by billionaires or national agencies. He didn't start with selling cars or books. He was a dreamer with a pen, a vision, and a firm belief that space exploration belongs to all of us.</p>
        <p>In a converted workshop just outside Austin, Locke began sketching out ideas not just for ships, but for systems—reusable, modular, human-centric platforms for space logistics, science, and long-term habitation. His early designs became the backbone of what would one day become the <strong>Hermes Network</strong>, <strong>Odin’s Eye</strong>, and the crowning jewel of our program, <strong>Project Thor</strong>.</p>
        <p>More than a founder, RH Locke is a storyteller. He reminds us that every mission we launch is a chapter in something larger. Something shared. Something human.</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">StarReach exists because one person looked up—and decided not to wait for permission.</p>
